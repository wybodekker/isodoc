Short description:
The isodoc class is used for the preparation of letters and invoices.
Future versions will support the preparation of other, similar
documents. Documents are easily configured to the user's requirements
through key=value options.
At the origin of this class was Victor Eijkhout’s NTG brief class,
which implements the NEN1026 standard.
The package contains several examples, that are used in the documentation.
These can individually be compiled, which may be useful for users to
experiment with.
